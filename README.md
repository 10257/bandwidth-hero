Bandwidth Hero is a Chrome extension which compresses images on the page to save bandwidth.

## How It Works?

![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayastreb/bandwidth-hero/master/docs/workflow.png)

1. When active, Bandwidth Hero prevents original images loading and replaces them with a placeholder
2. It sends each image URL to the compression proxy server, hosted at Heroku
3. Proxy server downloads the original image and compresses it
4. When image is compressed, proxy server uploads it to specified Amazon S3 bucket for storage
5. Proxy server returns compressed image URL to Bandwidth Hero
6. Bandwidth Hero finds corresponding element on the page an updates its image source with compressed one
7. Browser loads compressed image from Amazon S3 bucket

## Privacy Consideration

Please consider, that this extension has access to all the images you browse and stores compressed copies of them on my Amazon S3 bucket for up to 3 days.
If you don't want your images to be stored on some stranger's server, you can run your own proxy server.

You will need a free Heroku account and an Amazon AWS account, 
which is also available for free for up to one year, 
and after that it costs just pennies per gigabyte of traffic.

Please refer to [Server Docs](https://github.com/ayastreb/bandwidth-hero/tree/master/server) 
for detailed instructions on how to run your own proxy.
